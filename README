This directory contains the openLTE source code.  For support, please
subscribe to openlte-discuss@lists.sourceforge.net.  Details can be
found at sourceforge.net/projects/openlte/.

The directory structure for the project is:
octave              Octave test code
cmn_hdr             Common header files
liblte              C++ library of commonly used LTE functions
openlte_file_scan   A gnu-radio LTE file scanner application

To build the C++ and python code use the following:

  $ ./bootstrap
  $ ./configure
  $ make

To install the C++ and python code use the following:

  $ ./bootstrap
  $ ./configure
  $ make
  $ make install

To use the installed C++ and python code, set the PYTHONPATH
env variable to <python_install_dir>/dist-packages/gnuradio/
for instance /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/gnuradio/.
Then run openlte_file_scan/python/openlte_file_scan.py and
specify a recorded LTE file as the input. For example:

  $ ./openlte_file_scan/python/openlte_file_scan.py lte_file.bin

The recorded LTE file currently must be interleaved 8-bit I and
Q samples recorded at 30.72MHz.

To use the octave code, run the top level octave .m files:
lte_fdd_dl_transmit.m and lte_fdd_dl_receive.m.  If multiple
transmit antennas are used, the outputs need to be combined
before input to the receiver.
